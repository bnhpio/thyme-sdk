# Commands

The CLI exposes four primary commands. Each subpage includes Bun-friendly usage snippets, option tables, execution flow, and best practices.

| Command | Purpose | Typical Stage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`thyme create`](/cli/commands/thyme-create) | Scaffold projects or functions | Day 0 / feature kick-off |
| [`thyme auth`](/cli/commands/thyme-auth) | Store auth tokens in `.env` | Once per environment |
| [`thyme simulate`](/cli/commands/thyme-simulate) | Sandbox & onchain validation | CI + pre-merge |
| [`thyme upload`](/cli/commands/thyme-upload) | Package and deploy bundles | Release pipeline |

## Global Flags

- `--env <path>`: load environment variables from a specific file (defaults to `.env`)
- `--debug` *(planned)*: emit verbose logs for sandbox/onchain stages

## Workflow Recommendations

1. Run `thyme create` whenever you need a new function—avoid copying folders manually.
2. Call `thyme auth` in local and CI environments separately so you can revoke tokens independently.
3. Gate every PR with `thyme simulate` and publish summaries via CI artifacts.
4. Limit `thyme upload` to release branches and wrap it in multisig-approved pipelines.

Use the [SDK + CLI workflow guide](/cli-sdk) if you need a narrative from authoring to deployment.
