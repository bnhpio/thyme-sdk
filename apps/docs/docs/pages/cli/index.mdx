# Thyme CLI

`@bnhpio/thyme-cli` is the automation control plane: scaffold workspaces, persist secrets, simulate runs, and deploy artifacts without custom scripts. Use Bun for installs and local execution to stay aligned with the project toolchain.

```bash
bun add -g @bnhpio/thyme-cli
thyme --help
```

## Documentation Map

- [Quick Start](/cli/quick-start): install, initialize, and run your first upload with Bun
- [Commands](/cli/commands): per-command docs with usage, options, flow charts, and tips
  - [`thyme create`](/cli/commands/thyme-create)
  - [`thyme auth`](/cli/commands/thyme-auth)
  - [`thyme simulate`](/cli/commands/thyme-simulate)
  - [`thyme upload`](/cli/commands/thyme-upload)
- [Configuration](/cli/configuration): structure of `untl.toml`, `.env`, profiles, and troubleshooting

## When to Use the CLI

- Need reproducible project scaffolding (templates, env files, default functions)
- Require sandboxed simulations that match production packaging
- Want to guard deployments behind org IDs and auth tokens without touching scripts
- Prefer bundling runners with the SDK but delegating orchestration to an opinionated tool

Pair the CLI with the [Thyme SDK](/thyme-sdk) for maximum flexibility: author logic with the SDK, operationalize it with the CLI.
